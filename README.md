# Faux Finance

This app is meant to provide users with the ability to "buy" and "sell" stocks with their real time prices, and see how their portfolio does. Each user starts with $10,000 and is able to purchase shares of any stock that the IEX API provides.

Inspiration form this project comes from Harvard's CS50 course, which was a great resource for me teaching myself software development, and I highly reccomend it.

This project was built using React for the front-end, and Node and Express for the back-end, with a PostgreSQL database, and deployed through Heroku!
