            <div><p>You start your account with $10,000 and can buy and sell stocks as you please. All prices are current real-time stock prices, so you will

            <div ><h1>The Purpose</h1></div>
            <div ><p>The point of this app is to provide a way for people to gain experience in and understand the stock market.
            It is well understood that investing (some) of your money is a good idea, and can lead to financial growth. But it also connects
            you more with the world, helping you to understand the national and global economy much better. However, this is not to say that buying stocks will make you smarter or a millionaire. Investing takes research, hard work, courage, and PATIENCE.
            For this reason, many people don't invest, but that is the WORST choice you can make. Use this tool to see for yourself what investing in stocks is like, and the returns one can expect. 
            The goal here is to learn more about best practices when it comes to personal finance- whether that means casually investing in a few companies you believe in, daytrading stocks constantly, 
            or placing your money in a low-cost index fund and forgetting about it- it up to you. I just wanted to provide a risk-free way of learning about and experiencing
            investing.</p></div>
